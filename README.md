# Hypothesis-testing-Autolib electric car-sharing service company
Working with the Autolib electric car-sharing service company data set to investigate a claim about the blue cars, did a hypothesis testing to try and answer the question on whether the number of blue cars taken on weekdays same as number of bluecars taken on weekends. The null and alternative hypothesis were as follows:
Ho: The number of Bluecars taken from postal code 75015 is the same as in postal code 75017 during weekends.
Ha: The number of Bluecars taken from postal code 75015 is different from that of postal code 75017 during weekends.
